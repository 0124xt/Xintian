A little bit more about me..

I was born and raised Wuhan, China, a beautiful city sitting along both sides of Yangtze River in central China. I love the 过早 "guo zao" or breakfast culture in Wuhan not only because of the wide array of mouth-watering options we have, but that it serves as a celebration to start off a brand new day.
